## Current Training Status

### 🔄 Active Training Scripts
All three training scripts are currently running and in the **Feature Extraction** phase:

1. **Minimal Model** (`train_model_minimal.py`)
   - Status: 🔍 Feature Extraction (4.9% complete)
   - Estimated completion: ~17:00 (40 minutes total)
   - Configuration: 5 epochs, small dataset, 15 max_length

2. **Fast Model** (`train_model_fast.py`)
   - Status: 🔍 Feature Extraction (4.4% complete)
   - Configuration: 10 epochs, medium dataset, 20 max_length

3. **Optimized Model** (`train_model_optimized.py`)
   - Status: 🔍 Feature Extraction (5.4% complete)
   - Configuration: 20 epochs, full dataset, 40 max_length

### 📊 System Resources
- **CPU Usage:** 60.4%
- **Memory Usage:** 11.3GB / 15.3GB (74%)
- **Disk Usage:** 37.5GB / 117.2GB (32%)

### 📁 Current Model Files
- `image_captioning_model.h5` (17.57 MB) - Original model
- `quick_test_model.h5` (17.57 MB) - Quick test model
- `quick_test_tokenizer.pkl` (28.33 KB) - Quick test tokenizer

## Expected Timeline

### Short Term (Next 30 minutes)
- Minimal model should complete training
- New model file: `minimal_model.h5` and `minimal_tokenizer.pkl`
- First opportunity to test improved caption quality

### Medium Term (Next 1-2 hours)
- Fast model should complete training
- New model file: `fast_model.h5` and `fast_tokenizer.pkl`
- Better balance of speed and quality

### Long Term (Next 3-6 hours)
- Optimized model should complete training
- New model file: `optimized_model.h5` and `optimized_tokenizer.pkl`
- Highest quality captions with full dataset training

## Next Steps

### 1. Monitor Progress
Run these commands to check status:
```bash
python monitor_training.py          # Check for new model files
python estimate_progress.py           # Get updated time estimates
```

### 2. Test New Models
When models complete, test them with:
```bash
# Test minimal model (first to complete)
python generate_captions.py --image images/test.jpg --model minimal_model.h5 --tokenizer minimal_tokenizer.pkl --max-length 15

# Compare with current model
python generate_captions.py --image images/test.jpg --model quick_test_model.h5 --tokenizer quick_test_tokenizer.pkl --max-length 15
```

### 3. Evaluate Results
- Compare caption quality and diversity
- Check for overfitting or underfitting
- Test on multiple images to assess generalization

## Training Configurations Summary

| Model | Epochs | Dataset | Max Length | Vocab Size | Embedding | LSTM Units | Expected Time |
|-------|--------|---------|------------|------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Minimal | 5 | Small (1K) | 15 | 3,000 | 64 | 128 | ~40 min |
| Fast | 10 | Medium (3K) | 20 | 5,000 | 128 | 256 | ~2-3 hrs |
| Optimized | 20 | Full (8K) | 40 | 10,000 | 256 | 512 | ~4-6 hrs |

## Efficiency Improvements Implemented

### Data Processing
- ✅ Efficient data generators for memory management
- ✅ Subset sampling for faster training
- ✅ Optimized batch processing

### Model Architecture
- ✅ Mixed precision training (optimized script)
- ✅ Simplified architectures for faster convergence
- ✅ Reduced parameters for minimal/fast models

### Training Optimizations
- ✅ Early stopping and learning rate reduction
- ✅ Model checkpointing
- ✅ TensorBoard monitoring (optimized script)

## Troubleshooting

### If Training Seems Stuck
1. Check system resources (CPU/memory usage)
2. Monitor terminal output for errors
3. Check if feature extraction is progressing
4. Consider stopping and restarting if no progress for >1 hour

### If Models Don't Improve
1. Check learning rate settings
2. Verify data preprocessing
3. Consider adjusting model architecture
4. Test with different subset sizes

### Next Actions
- [ ] Wait for minimal model completion (~20 more minutes)
- [ ] Test first completed model
- [ ] Compare results with baseline
- [ ] Decide whether to continue with longer training based on results
